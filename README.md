## jQuery UI Extensions ##

See the README in each folder for documentation.

### Installation ###

Select the extension you want to use, take the script and put it in your app's javascript dir and refer to it *after* the jQuery standard libs.

### Will these clobber existing jQuery UI stuff? ###

No, they work alongside.

### Which versions of jQuery will this work with? ###

Presumably 1.8+, but to be honest, I don't do any testing beyond the day that I write the individual extensions. At some point I will have time to actually write tests and documentation and add more extensions.


### Contributing ###

Feel free to send PRs to add descriptions to the demos.
